    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Teach What You Know, Learn What You Don't – And Earn While You Do!</h2>
    <p className="mb-4">Welcome to SkillSwap Hub, the world’s first revolutionary platform where you can learn, teach, and earn – all in one place. We are not just a learning community, but a global ecosystem of knowledge exchange where every skill matters, every learner counts, and every teacher grows.<br />
    In today’s fast-changing world, education is no longer confined to classrooms, textbooks, or expensive courses.

That’s where SkillSwap Hub steps in – a unique platform designed to empower students, professionals, educators, and innovators by giving them the freedom to both gain knowledge and share knowledge while also building an income stream.</p>

    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Our Vision</h2>
    <p className="mb-4">Our vision is simple yet powerful: to create a world where knowledge is not restricted, but exchanged freely, fairly, and globally. We dream of a society where learning is accessible to everyone, where teaching is not limited to classrooms, and where earning opportunities come directly from your skills.<br />
    ...existing content...
    This is the world we dream of. A world where learning never stops, where opportunities don’t depend on wealth or location, and where anyone, anywhere, can rise by lifting others.</p>

    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Our Mission</h2>
    <p className="mb-4">To democratize mastery: transforming every individual into a lifelong learner, teacher, and innovator, and turning knowledge into a global currency of impact and opportunity.</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
      <li>Knowledge as Currency: Hum sirf learning nahi, balki ek aisa ecosystem create kar rahe hain jahan skills, ideas aur expertise ka real-world value hai—jaise ek global economy of knowledge.</li>
      <li>Everyone Can Lead: Har learner sirf seekhne wala nahi, balki teacher aur influencer bhi ban sakta hai, chahe wo small town se ho ya global city se.</li>
      <li>Lifelong Innovation: Learning ko finite activity nahi, balki lifelong journey aur innovation ka source banaya ja raha hai.</li>
      <li>Impact Beyond Borders: Yeh mission education aur earning ko connect karta hai, aur har ek individual ko empower karta hai to make tangible impact in their community and the world.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">What Makes Us Unique?</h2>
    <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
      <li>Dual Role System – On SkillSwap Hub, you don’t have to choose between being a learner or a teacher. Every user automatically gets both roles. For example, you can teach coding to someone while at the same time learning graphic design from another person. This flexibility encourages knowledge exchange and creates a balanced ecosystem where everyone grows together.</li>
      <li>Peer-to-Peer Learning – Instead of relying only on professional tutors or pre-recorded courses, SkillSwap Hub allows you to learn directly from real people who have mastered specific skills. It’s like learning guitar from a friend who’s already good at it, or improving your interview skills from someone who recently cracked a job. This makes learning more practical, relatable, and effective.</li>
      <li>Global Reach – The platform is not restricted by geography. Whether you’re in a small town or a big city, you can connect with learners and teachers across the globe. This global exposure helps you not only learn different skills but also understand diverse cultures, work ethics, and perspectives.</li>
      <li>Affordable & Accessible – Traditional coaching, online courses, or private tuitions can be very expensive. SkillSwap Hub offers a cost-effective alternative because it’s peer-to-peer. Many sessions are free or priced much lower than market standards. Plus, anyone with internet access can join, making it inclusive for students, professionals, and learners from all backgrounds.</li>
      <li>Gamified & Interactive Learning – SkillSwap Hub is not boring or one-sided. The platform uses gamification techniques such as badges, leaderboards, quizzes, and skill challenges to keep users engaged. This makes learning feel like a game where you compete, collaborate, and celebrate achievements — making the process both fun and rewarding.</li>
      <li>Earning Potential – Unlike most platforms where you only pay to learn, SkillSwap Hub lets you earn by teaching others. If you have a valuable skill — whether it’s coding, photography, public speaking, or even cooking — you can conduct sessions, provide guidance, and get paid. This creates a self-sustaining ecosystem where knowledge not only grows but also generates income.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Our Core Values</h2>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
      <li><b>Collaboration over Competition – Knowledge grows when shared.</b><br />We believe true learning happens when individuals come together, exchange ideas, and uplift each other. Unlike competitive environments that create pressure and barriers, SkillSwap Hub promotes a culture where peers collaborate to achieve success together. Every user is both a learner and a teacher, ensuring that knowledge flows in multiple directions, making the community stronger. Collaboration builds empathy, teamwork, and trust – essential values for growth in both education and professional life.</li>
      <li><b>Accessibility for All – Every individual should have equal access to quality learning.</b><br />Education is a right, not a privilege. At SkillSwap Hub, we are committed to making learning opportunities available to everyone. Our platform ensures inclusivity by removing financial, geographical, and social barriers. Whether you are a school student, a college aspirant, a working professional, or a lifelong learner – you can find opportunities to gain and share knowledge. By integrating free access models and affordable micro-tutoring, we make sure no one is left behind in the journey of self-improvement.</li>
      <li><b>Innovation & Growth – Constant evolution to meet the demands of the modern learner.</b><br />The world is changing rapidly, and so are the ways we learn and teach. At SkillSwap Hub, we constantly innovate with features like AI matchmaking, gamification, interactive sessions, and community-based challenges. We are not just building a platform; we are building an evolving ecosystem that adapts to the demands of modern education. Innovation drives both personal and collective growth, ensuring that learners acquire not only knowledge but also adaptability and creativity.</li>
      <li><b>Transparency & Trust – Honest, secure, and fair exchange of knowledge and earnings.</b><br />Trust is the foundation of any learning exchange. SkillSwap Hub ensures all interactions are secure, transparent, and fair. Our system provides clarity in how tutors earn, how learners pay, and how every transaction is handled. By implementing verified profiles, fair rating systems, and open feedback mechanisms, we build credibility in every connection. This value protects both learners and educators, ensuring that honesty and fairness remain at the heart of our ecosystem.</li>
      <li><b>Empowerment through Skills – Skills are the real currency of the future.</b><br />In today’s world, skills matter more than degrees. SkillSwap Hub believes that skills are the true currency of the future. We empower individuals to not only learn but also monetize their expertise. By teaching others, users gain confidence, leadership skills, and financial independence. The platform prepares people for real-world challenges, ensuring they stay relevant, employable, and future-ready. Skill empowerment creates a ripple effect – one person’s skill can change many lives.</li>
